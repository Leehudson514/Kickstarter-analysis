# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

## Overview of Project
* Using data provided on Kickstarter Campaigns to complete an analysis that will give further insights into the kickstarter industry.
### Purpose
* The purpose of this analysis was to determine the relationship between kickstarter campaign launch dates and their funding goals to see what impact they have on overall outcomes.
* The client needed to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their lunch dates and their funding goals to determine the next steps to take for their Kickstarter.

## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes based on Launch Date
* Kickstarters that launched in May and June had the highest successful outcomes.
* Campaigns that start in January and Feburary had the highest chance to fail.

### Analysis of Outcomes based on Goals
* Campaigns with lower goals of "Less than 1000" and between "1000 to 4999" had a higher percentage of success.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
* Difficulties experienced with with this analysis involved uploading images to Github Read.Me, this was resolved with the help of Google.
* There were also challenges with the function COUNTIFS() and copying it over to other cells. At first I had to manually change each function to have them make the correct calculation and then realised there was a better a way. I incorpated the use of "$" into my formulas to reduce the amount of information I had to manually input into each cell.

## Results
* The results of this analysis show that Kickstarter Campaigns have the highest chances of success if they start in the months of May and June coupled with having a fundraising goal of below $4999.

### Limitations
* Dataset is from 2017, need more recent data for it to be relevant to 2021.
* Data heavily weighted with projects that had goals of $14999 or less, making up a total of 92% of total projects. More campagins need to be conducted with a goal of $15000 and more to be able to accurately determine that kickstarters with goals of $4999 are more likely to succeed.

### Recommendations
* It would be beneficial for additional tables and graphs focusing on the following:
  * Duration of campagins, to assist future campagins to determine if they are on track with their goal.
  * Comparison of subcategories, compare different genres of theatre to see how they stack up against eachother.
  * Comparison of countries, to determine if there is a difference in campagin outcome with regards to location.
* Additonally, collecting more data on failed projects to determine what they have in common.
